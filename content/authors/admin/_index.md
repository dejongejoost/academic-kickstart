Joost de Jong is a PhD candidate in Experimental Psychology at the University of Groningen studying temporal cognition. Humans can perceive, perform and reason about highly complex tasks that extend over time, such as cooking. To do this, we need to keep in mind when something happened and anticipate when something will happen next. He uses computer simulations of spiking neural networks to study how the brain represents time and develops new experiments to study how humans represent time in realistic situations.
